## Installation

Run the following command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install backpack.css --save-dev
```

If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use this command instead:

```bash
yarn add backpack.css --dev
```

CDN version coming soon, [see](https://github.com/chris-pearce/backpack.css/issues/15).

## How to use

Typically you'll be wanting to import all of backpack.css styles into your project but you do have the choice to be selective. The one strict rule is that it must come before your project's CSS to ensure correct ordering of your styles and to be able to override any of backpack.css styles.

### Importing with a bundler

If you're using a bundler such as [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and wanting to import all of backpack.css then your projects entry point should look like this:

```js
import 'backpack.css';
import '[path(s)-to-your-project-css]';
```

If you want to be selective then simply `import` the backpack.css files you need, for example:

```js
import 'backpack.css/lib/resets.css';
import 'backpack.css/lib/content-sectioning.css';
import 'backpack.css/lib/forms.css';
import '[path(s)-to-your-project-css]';
```

The order at which you import each module is important, to see this order and what `.css` files are available refer to backpack.css [`index.css`](src/index.css).

### Importing without a bundler

CDN version coming soon, [see](https://github.com/chris-pearce/backpack.css/issues/15). In the meantime you can link to the hosted version on [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com) via a `<link>` element in your HTML Head, however, make sure it comes before your project's CSS, e.g.:

```html
<head>
  [â€¦]
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/backpack.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="[path-to-your-project-css]">
</head>
```

### Overriding

backpack.css is just CSS so you can easily override any of backpack.css styles just as you would override any CSS, as in, via the rules of the cascade and specificity.

For example, if you don't want to use `system-ui` as the global `font-family` set in [`main-root.css`](src/main-root.css) then simply redeclare it in your project CSS like so:

```css
html {
  font-family: serif;
}
```

## Motivation

Nowadays I'm building [React](https://reactjs.org/) applications that have highly componentised User Interfaces (UI) making use of native CSS layout mechanisms such as [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and [Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/). I'm no longer finding the need for heavy handed CSS frameworks that handle most of my UI concerns, especially layout and utilities. Instead I build components with a smidgen of global styles.

What I do need, however, are a bunch of smart and sensible foundational styles suited for applications that I would typically forget project to projectâ€”think [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and then some. Something that is lightweight, super easy to intergrate, and can easily be overriden or allow for modular use, thus giving birth to backpack.css ðŸ™‚ðŸŽ’.

## What it does

- Applies sensible form element resets, normalisations, and fixes, e.g.: _remove all user-agent styles from buttons_.
- Applies sensible interactive styles, e.g.: _avoid 300ms click delay on touch devices_.
- Applies foundational print styles.
- Applies the nicer `border-box` value for the `box-sizing` property to all elements.
- Applies sensible OpenType features, e.g.: _enables lining numerals, tabular numerals, and slashed zero, for table content_.
- Makes all images and videos responsive.
- Removes margins, paddings, and borders from all elements except `<input>` so that everything is on an even playing field.
- Removes list bullets.
- Removes all user-agent styles from heading elements and resets them to have the same styles as the body copy.
- Removes the "focus ring" for mouse users.

_And moreâ€¦_

All of the CSS is very well documentated if you want to dig deeper.

## Evolution

This is the third CSS framework/library I've created. Looking at each one lets you see how UI development has evolved over the years with each iteration getting smaller and smaller.

## Browser support

- Chrome
- Edge
- Firefox
- Internet Explorer 11 _(partial)_
- Safari 10+
- Opera

Not everything will work in Internet Explorer 11, e.g.: the [`system-ui`](https://caniuse.com/#feat=font-family-system-uiZ) font, however, anything that doesn't work will simply degrade gracefully.

It's recommended to have [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) set up as part of your project's build.
