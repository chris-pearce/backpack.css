/**
 * Scope heading styles to classes instead of an element selector so that styles
 * get divorced from semantics. I.e., if you want a `<h4>` to look like a `<h2>`
 * you can easily do this. Therefore, all heading elements get reset to have the
 * same styles as the body copy. See:
 * https://medium.com/fed-or-dead/handling-headings-in-a-ui-component-library-2587de93c890
